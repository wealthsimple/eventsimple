## Unreleased

## 1.4.1 - 2024-04-28
### Fixed
- Fix Sidebar scroll

## 1.4.0 - 2024-04-02
### Changed
- Production ready release of the outbox consumer
- Multiple consumers on an event stream are supported
- The outbox processor is instantiated once and takes the event as an argument.
- Added proper SIGTERM event handling and fixed shutdown behaviour.

## 1.3.3 - 2024-04-02
### Changed
- add `parent_record` configuration so it can be easily overwritten

## 1.3.2 - 2024-03-01
### Changed
- Updated dependencies to fix a security vulnerability

## 1.3.1 - 2024-01-19
### Changed
- Restore readonly status to the original status after enable_writes! block.

## 1.3.0 - 2024-01-14
### Changed
- Prevent manual write access to the entity table by default. This is to prevent
  accidental writes to the entity table. Use entity.enable_writes! to enable writes.

## 1.2.3 - 2024-01-11
### Changed
- Fix rendering of deleted events

## 1.2.2 - 2023-11-29
### Changed
- Add support for filtering events by aggregate model attributes.

## 1.2.1 - 2023-11-18
### Changed
- Allow timestamp data in events to override default timestamps update.
- This allows us to create temporal events for example in the case of snapshots.

## 1.2.0 - 2023-09-26
### Changed
- Fix issue where the reactor worker might not work correctly for models not inheriting from ApplicationRecord.

## 1.1.3 - 2023-07-07
### Changed
- Sidekiq is no longer a required dependency.

## 1.1.2 - 2023-06-22
### Changed
- Fix exception noise generated by early global_id desrialization

## 1.1.1 - 2023-06-19
### Changed
- Remove active_job_parent_klass config introduced in 1.1.0. There isn't a usecase for it yet,
  and it was causing loading issues.

## 1.1.0 - 2023-06-11
### Changed
- Reactors now use ActiveJob instead of Sidekiq directly. This allows for more
  flexibility in the future and allows for the use of other job backends.
  The reactor class definition must now inherit from Eventsimple::Reactor and are no longer
  instantiated with the event as an argument. Instead, the event is passed to the `call` method.
  This change is backwards compatible with existing inflight reactor jobs.

## 1.0.0 - 2023-05-03
### Changed
- Release under MIT license

## 0.9.1 - 2023-04-29
### Changed
- add `metadata_klass` configuration so it can be easily overwritten

## 0.9.0 - 2023-04-25
### Changed
- update timestamp of projection on deleted events. We originally had deleted
    events act as a `noop` but when checking `model.project_matches_events?` it would fail
    since the original projection would have included the timestamp update.
    We don't want to require a projection of every instance of a model when deleting an event so
    we now update the timestamps on deleted event projections.

## 0.8.0 - 2023-04-18
### Changed
- Rename gem to Eventsimple

## 0.7.3 - 2023-04-14
### Changed
- Adding some missing tests

## 0.7.2 - 2023-04-06
### Changed
- Remove use of ApplicationRecord.descendants to determine the list of models
    to display in the UI. This conflicts with components using packwerk.
    A side effect of this change is that the UI will no longer display STI models.
    STI models did not work properly in the UI anyway, so this is ok.

## 0.7.1 - 2023-04-11
### Changed
- Eventsimple no longer requires a Dispatcher class to be defined.
    Instead, dispatchers must now be registered in the event configuration.
    Each dispatcher must inherit from Eventsimple::Dispatcher

## 0.7.0 - 2023-03-29
### Changed
- Remove custom database role configuration as it is not needed
- Allow concurrency retry count to be configurable
- Require Rails >= 7.0.0. Eventsimple is not compatible with older versions.
- aggregate_id is now a required property on event configuration
